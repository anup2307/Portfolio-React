# Portfolio-React
This portfolio of work can showcase my skills and talents to employers looking to fill a part-time or full-time position. An effective portfolio highlights our strongest work as well as the thought processes behind it. 

## User Story

```md
AS AN employer looking for candidates with experience building single-page applications
I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed React portfolio of work samples
SO THAT I can assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position
```
